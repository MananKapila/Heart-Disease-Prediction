<p> In this project we took a dataset on heart diseases, it consists on 13 features with more than 300 training examples,
which help us to predict whether the person has heart disease or not. </p>
 For Visualization we used:
 <ul>
 <li> Matplotlib </li>
 <li> Plotly and Cufflinks </li>
 <li> Seaborn </li>
 </ul>
 Other libraries used are:
 <ul>
 <li> Numpy </li>
